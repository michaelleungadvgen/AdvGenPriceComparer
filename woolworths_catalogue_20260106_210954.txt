Website accessibility
New South Wales | Liquor Act 2007: No alcohol can be sold or supplied to anyone under 18. It's against the law.

For all Woolworths Online liquor orders, Woolworths Group is acting as an agent on behalf of Endeavour Group Limited (ABN 77 159 767 843). Pricing (including any 'was' or 'strikethrough' price) displayed on the Woolworths website and app for these liquor products are provided by Endeavour Group and reflects pricing on their BWS website which is set by location. They do not, however, include particular specials, clearances and offers which are exclusive to BWS. For Everyday Market from Woolworths orders involving the sale of liquor, Woolworths Marketplace Pty Limited is acting as an agent on behalf of the relevant Everyday Market partner. Woolworths Online supports the Responsible Service of Alcohol. For liquor licence numbers visit the Liquor and Tobacco Licences page.

If you wish to voluntarily exclude yourself from being able to purchase alcohol from our site, you can find out more at our Alcohol Self Exclusion page.
