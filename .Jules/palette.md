## 2024-05-23 - Screen Reader Accessibility in WPF
**Learning:** The existing ToolTip attributes on icon-only buttons are insufficient for screen readers in WPF. Screen readers rely on the AutomationProperties.Name attached property to announce elements correctly.
**Action:** Explicitly define AutomationProperties.Name on all icon-only buttons in WPF XAML files to ensure they are accessible to assistive technologies.


## 2025-02-17 - WPF Icon-only Button Accessibility
**Learning:** In WPF applications using `ui:Button` and `ui:SymbolIcon`, relying solely on the `ToolTip` attribute is insufficient for screen readers. Icon-only buttons lack proper text representation without explicitly defining an ARIA label.
**Action:** Always define `AutomationProperties.Name` on icon-only buttons to ensure they are fully accessible to screen readers, just like using `aria-label` in web development.


## 2025-03-17 - Custom UI Element Accessibility
**Learning:** Custom window frames, overlay UI, and secondary controls often use Unicode characters (e.g., "✕" for close/clear) instead of formal icon controls. These elements inherently lack screen reader accessibility.
**Action:** Always verify custom UI elements and overlays to ensure `AutomationProperties.Name` and visual tooltips are applied to buttons that rely exclusively on text symbols.
